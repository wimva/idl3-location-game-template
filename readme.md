# Location Based Game Framework

## Usage

`/index.html` will actually use your GPS coordinates for the game.

`/test.html` is meant for testing only, you can fake your GPS coordinates in here by moving the pin on the map.

## Develop

To use the test-map, you'll need to create an account on MapBox and create `/scripts/secrets.js` in the same way as the example `/scripts/secrets.example.js`
